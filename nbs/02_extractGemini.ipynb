      "Okay, here's an efficient prompt for an LLM to extract information from a financial statement image and output it in Markdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "```prompt\n",
      "You are an expert AI financial statement data extractor. Your task is to analyze images of financial statements and extract all relevant information into a well-structured Markdown document.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Input:** An image of a financial statement (e.g., Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement, or Notes to Financial Statements).\n",
      "\n",
      "**Instructions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Thorough Extraction:** Extract all textual data from the image, including headings, labels, values, footnotes, and narrative text. Ensure accuracy in transcribing numbers and dates.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Markdown Formatting:** Organize the extracted information using Markdown syntax for clear presentation.\n",
      "    *   Use headings (H1-H6) to structure the document according to the statement's layout (e.g., Balance Sheet, Assets, Liabilities & Equity).\n",
      "    *   Format tables using Markdown table syntax (e.g., `| Header 1 | Header 2 |\\n|---|---|`). Reconstruct the tabular structure accurately.\n",
      "    *   Use lists for itemized information.\n",
      "    *   Bold key values and labels where appropriate.\n",
      "    *   Use blockquotes for any narrative text or footnotes.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Data Transcription:**\n",
      "    *   **Tables:**  Accurately transcribe table data, including column headers, row labels, and numerical values.  Ensure correct alignment within the Markdown table.\n",
      "    *   **Figures/Graphs:**  **Do not return any images.** For figures and graphs, extract any textual descriptions, titles, axis labels, legends, and key data points (if discernible and textually represented).  Describe the general trend or relationship shown in the graph in a concise sentence or two.  If specific numerical values are associated with data points in the graph and are readable, include them. If the graph data is not textually represented, only return a summary of what the graph depicts.\n",
      "    *   **Footnotes:** Include all footnotes, clearly identified and linked to the relevant sections of the financial statement.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **No Images:**  **Do not return any images.** Your output should be purely textual Markdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.  **Completeness:** Aim for a complete and accurate transcription of all information present in the image. If something is unreadable or ambiguous, indicate this in the Markdown with a clear note (e.g., `[UNREADABLE: Please review original image]`).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Output:** Provide the complete financial statement information in a single, continuous Markdown document.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example Output Snippet (Illustrative):**\n",
      "\n",
      "```markdown\n",

      "\n",
      "**Key Improvements & Explanation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Clear Role Definition:**  Starts by explicitly defining the LLM's role as a \"expert AI financial statement data extractor.\"\n",
      "*   **Explicit Instructions:** Provides step-by-step instructions, making the task clear and unambiguous.\n",
      "*   **Markdown Emphasis:** Clearly states the requirement for Markdown output and provides specific guidance on formatting tables, headings, and lists.\n",
      "*   **Handles Figures/Graphs Appropriately:**  The prompt explicitly instructs the LLM to *not* return images and provides specific instructions on how to describe figures and graphs textually.  It focuses on extracting key information that can be represented in text.  It also handles the case where graph data cannot be readily transcribed numerically.\n",
      "*   **Error Handling:** Includes instructions for handling unreadable or ambiguous data.\n",
      "*   **Output Example:** The example snippet illustrates the desired Markdown format, making the requirements even clearer.  Helps the LLM understand what a good output looks like.\n",
      "*   **Concise and Efficient:**  The prompt is relatively concise while still providing comprehensive instructions.\n",
      "*   **Completeness Emphasis:**  Stresses the importance of extracting all relevant information.\n",
      "* **Avoids Hallucinations:** By not returning any images, LLM is limited to the information reported in the original image.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How to use this prompt:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Replace `[Insert Image Here or reference to image location]`** with the actual image data (e.g., a base64 encoded image string) or a URL pointing to the image. The method of image input will depend on the specific LLM platform you are using.\n",
      "2.  Adjust the example snippet if needed to more closely reflect the type of financial statements you will be processing.\n",
      "3.  Test and refine the prompt based on the LLM's initial outputs.  You might need to adjust instructions or add more examples to get the desired results.\n",
      "\n",
      "This prompt should significantly improve the LLM's ability to extract and present financial statement data in a structured Markdown format. Remember to iterate and refine the prompt based on your specific needs and the LLM's performance.\n",
